Questions linger <b_timex type="DURATION">two decades<e_timex> after assassination in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex>
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">ROME<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ <b_timex type="DURATION">Twenty years<e_timex> after terrorists kidnapped former
Premier <b_enamex type="PERSON">Aldo Moro<e_enamex> and left his bullet-riddled body in the back of a
parked car, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> question still haunts <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex>: Could he have been
saved?
	   The anniversary of the kidnapping is being marked by television
programs, new books, a play and published interviews with convicted
members of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Red Brigades<e_enamex> who took part in the crime.
	   But the ex-terrorists have only added fuel to the debate about
the assassination, which became the defining moment in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex>'s
reign of terrorism in the <b_timex type="DATE">1970s<e_timex> and early <b_timex type="DATE">80s<e_timex>.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> was abducted in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex> on <b_timex type="DATE">March 16, 1978<e_timex>, in an ambush that
killed <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex> of his bodyguards. His body turned up <b_timex type="DURATION">55 days<e_timex> later in
a car parked around the corner from the headquarters of both the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Christian Democrat<e_enamex> and <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Communist<e_enamex> parties.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> had just negotiated an agreement for the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Communists<e_enamex> and
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Christian Democrats<e_enamex>, the leading political forces in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex> at that
time, to collaborate.
	   It was a historic agreement, a break with the long-standing
policy backed by the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> to keep <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Western Europe<e_enamex>'s largest
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">communist<e_enamex> party away from power.
	   Those political parties no longer exist, done in by scandals and
an end to the Cold War that also took the bite out of the
ideological divisions that so marked Italian society during the
years of bullets and bombs.
	   The kidnapping and slaying stiffened <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Italy<e_enamex>'s resolve to fight
domestic terrorism, marking the beginning of the end to urban
guerrilla gangs in the country.
	   Then-premier <b_enamex type="PERSON">Giulio Andreotti<e_enamex>, like <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Christian Democrat<e_enamex>
and now on trial on charges of favoring the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">mafia<e_enamex>, insisted earlier
this month that the government did everything it could.
	   ``To free <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex>, we activated everybody, including the armed
forces,'' <b_enamex type="PERSON">Andreotti<e_enamex> said in a roundtable organized by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Corriere
della Sera<e_enamex> newspaper.
	   The government stuck to hard-line policy, refusing any
compromise, such as freeing terrorist prisoners despite <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex>'s
increasingly desperate pleas.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Mario Moretti<e_enamex>, convicted as the triggerman, was quoted as saying
that ``just a signal, the recognition of the existence of political
prisoners'' would have been enough.
	   ``Instead, no one knew the right thing to do and we made a
mistake. We all made a mistake,'' he was quoted as saying by the
weekly <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vita<e_enamex>.
	   But <b_enamex type="PERSON">Anna Braghetti<e_enamex>, another former <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Red Brigade<e_enamex> member, gave a
different version, saying the decision to kill <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> came after a
poll among <b_numex type="CARDINAL">200<e_numex> members of the gang.
	   The group could not justify sparing <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex>'s life, given that the
government was not compromising and so many of his bodyguards were
killed in an attempt to kidnap him, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Braghetti<e_enamex> was quoted as saying
by <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Corriere della Sera<e_enamex>.
	   Attempts to close the dark chapter of the ``years of lead'' _ as
the terrorist period is called _ by an amnesty for those convicted
of terrorist crimes have been stalled in parliament. Opposition is
strong to clemency for ``blood crimes'' like the <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moro<e_enamex> killing.
