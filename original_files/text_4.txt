Elaborate Laces and Belle Epoque for <b_enamex type="PERSON">Christian Lacroix<e_enamex>
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">PARIS<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) - <b_enamex type="PERSON">Christian Lacroix<e_enamex> took his big audience on a
time-warp rollercoaster ride at his <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> show in the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Louvre<e_enamex>'s
Carrousel area.
	   It started out looking vaguely back to the <b_timex type="DATE">1940s<e_timex> with some
``<b_enamex type="PERSON" status="opt">Evita<e_enamex>'' hairdos, short flared skirts, a few sharply-tailored
shoulders in day wear. But then, there was not much day wear, and
clothes soon went into Belle Epoque evenings, via a modern ``star
trek'' of fabulous pearled fabrics.
	   Minimalism, so fashionable on international runways these days,
just does not grab <b_enamex type="PERSON">Christian Lacroix<e_enamex>.
	   ``After <b_timex type="DURATION">ten years<e_timex>, we must find a balance between glamour and
efficiency,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jean-Jacques Picart<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lacroix<e_enamex>'s partner on the
business side, though the house is under the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">LVMH<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Louis Vuitton
Moet Hennesy<e_enamex>) umbrella.
	   The glamour will undoubtedly not die out.
	   There were few clothes for day wear in this dressy collection
that tended to the too-fussy, as <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lacroix<e_enamex> often does. What to make
of a trouser suit with its tweedy masculine trousers and ruffled
lace-organza Victorian blouse?
	   Or the very tight sequin-spattered knit dress with its faux mink
appliques and high feathered hat? And with the spangled tights
shown with all the short clothes, the show often teetered between
the boulevard hooker territory and the disco.
	   But there were many wonderful moments here, including an
excellent short carmine moire silk coat tied at the waist over a
sky-blue lace knit dress.
	   Big fur collars and long tweed coats, the gold-black
tiger-striped lame trapeze coat, some of the great frock coats, and
a remarkable tie-dye effect silk in skirts and floppy <b_timex type="DATE">1930s<e_timex> pants,
looked like winners.
	   Sharply-fitted evening suits with pants had large, structured
shoulders. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Lacroix<e_enamex> has evolved quite far away from his famous shawl
and sloped shoulder looks of opening days over <b_timex type="DURATION">10 years<e_timex> ago.
	   The most modern-looking clothes were simply-cut soft gowns and
trouser outfits in black, gray and white pearled and diamante
fabrics with a <b_enamex type="LOCATION">milky way<e_enamex> effect.
	   And the party scene was complete in the Victorians or southern
belle evening styles capped by a fabulous red velvet gown with
crinolines and decollete a la <b_enamex type="PERSON">Scarlet O'Hara<e_enamex>, draped like curtains
and topped by a little red topper riding hat.
	   Earlier, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jean-Paul Gaultier<e_enamex> went yet again to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Arctic Circle<e_enamex>
for inspiration - as he did some years ago - but <b_timex type="DATE">Friday<e_timex> night's
offering was brilliant.
	   The atmosphere was hot and smoky, a bar scene created in the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" status="opt">Wagram dance hall<e_enamex>, notorious for the ``Last Tango in Paris.''
	   But the models, including <b_enamex type="PERSON">Naomi Campbell<e_enamex>, were dressed up like
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Nanook of the North<e_enamex> as they cavorted, smoked, drank champagne and
kibitzed with the audience at the bar.
	   There were many of those Siberian hats with flaps, fur, even
sequins at the end, and the parkas were very good-looking, many
quite tailored, in black and white.
	   Some of the impressions were of hippies from outer space, but in
spite of some crazy combinations like a layered look with long
ethnic skirt, fringed tunic and striped blazer, there was much to
admire.
	   The folklore Nordic knits were handsome, in sweaters, or
knee-length pants, and might have been topped by something like a
super taffeta full coat.
	   An excellent full gray knit sleeveless tunic with its straight
white pants was another winner. A double-faced gray coat with its
trouser suit was impeccable.
	   For evening wear at the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">North Pole<e_enamex>, girls could dress up in
handsome Nordic sweaters and full iridescent taffeta skirts, or top
one of the full striped skirts with a terrific short beige trench
coat.
	   ``I loved the show,'' said eminent English fashion historian
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Colin McDowell<e_enamex>. ``It was indeed <b_enamex type="PERSON">Nanook of the North<e_enamex> - with a trace
of existentialism.''
