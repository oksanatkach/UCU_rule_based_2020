cardboard box that he thought looked suspicious and was examining

suspicious objects that might be bombs planted by Palestinian
militant groups. However, police always urge the public not to
touch any such objects, but to report them to the nearest police
station.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Afula<e_enamex> bus station was the scene of a major terror attack in

people and injuring <b_numex type="CARDINAL">45<e_numex>. The militant Muslim group <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Hamas<e_enamex> claimed
