Long-awaited <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> statement on Holocaust ready
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">VATICAN CITY<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ More than <b_timex type="DURATION">10 years<e_timex> after it was promised in
a meeting with Jewish leaders, a major <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> document on the
Holocaust is ready.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> said <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> the document would be made public on
<b_timex type="DATE">Monday<e_timex>.
	   Jewish groups have been keenly awaiting the document to see if
it will continue to heal Jewish-Catholic relations.
	   The last <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> document of landmark proportions on Jewish
relations was a <b_timex type="DATE">1965<e_timex> statement that came out of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Second Vatican
Council<e_enamex> under <b_enamex type="PERSON">Paul VI<e_enamex>. ``Nostra Aetate'' (In Our Times) condemned
anti-Semitism and said the Jews cannot be collectively blamed for
the crucifixion of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Jesus<e_enamex>.
	   Pope <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Paul II<e_enamex> has dedicated much of his nearly <b_numex type="MEASURE">20-year<e_numex>-old
papacy to improving relations of the church with Jews, whom he
refers to as ``older brothers,'' after centuries of animosity.
	   Word of the latest document first came on <b_timex type="DATE">Sept. 1, 1987<e_timex>, during
a meeting between the pope and Jewish leaders in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Castel Gandolfo<e_enamex>,
the pontiff's <b_timex type="DATE">summer<e_timex> residence in the hills southeast of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex>.
	   The unprecedented meeting was hurriedly called as anxiety built
in the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> that Jews might boycott a ceremony during the then
soon-approaching papal visit to the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex>. Jews were
angered by the pope's audience earlier that year with then Austrian
President <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kurt Waldheim<e_enamex>, who was been accused of helping deport
Jews to <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> concentration camps, allegations he denied.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Castel Gandolfo<e_enamex> meeting was the first time Jewish
representatives had sat down for informal discussions with a pope.
	   Representatives at the <b_timex type="DATE">1987<e_timex> meeting said the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> planned to
publish a major document dealing with anti-Semitism and the
genocide of European Jews by the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazis<e_enamex> in World War II.
	   Since that meeting, <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Paul<e_enamex> has presided over several
milestones that improved relations with Jews, including the
establishment of diplomatic relations with <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Israel<e_enamex> in <b_timex type="DATE">1995<e_timex>.
	   Another ground-breaking step was the pope's visit to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Rome<e_enamex>'s main
synagogue in <b_timex type="DATE">1986<e_timex>.
	   Last <b_timex type="DATE">fall<e_timex>, the pope told a <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Vatican<e_enamex> seminar on anti-Jewish
currents in Christian theology that centuries of anti-Jewish
prejudice had figured in ``deadening'' Christian resistance toe the
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Nazi<e_enamex> persecution of Jews. But, to the disappointment of some Jewish
groups, the pope steered clear of blaming the church itself.
