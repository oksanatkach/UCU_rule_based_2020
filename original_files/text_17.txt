Underground political party has big dreams for <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">BEIJING<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ A small and secretive Chinese opposition party
has ambitious goals: bringing free elections, political democracy
and greater civil liberties than currently allowed by the ruling
<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party<e_enamex>, a <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>-based member of the underground group
says.
	   The <b_numex type="MEASURE">29-year<e_numex>-old member of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">China Democratic Justice Party<e_enamex>
stopped short of saying that they want to see the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">communists<e_enamex>
overthrown. Instead, he said they wanted to be able to compete on
an equal footing with them in elections and ``let the people decide
who rules.''
	   ``When we unite, we won't just be a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">few hundred<e_numex> or a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">few
thousand<e_numex> people. We'll be able to grow into <b_numex type="CARDINAL">several million<e_numex> people,
<b_numex type="CARDINAL">several tens of million<e_numex>,'' he said in an interview, the first by a
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>-based member of the group.
	   ``We'll be like the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" alt="Solidarity">Polish Solidarity union movement<e_enamex>, a
nationwide civil power.''
	   The organization announced its formation last month in faxes to
foreign reporters in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>. It said it was headquartered with
exiled Chinese dissidents in the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> and had members in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>. Until now, however, there had been no way of confirming the
group's existence with members inside <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>.
	   The group is the first known opposition party organized by
dissidents in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex> and overseas. But, forced to operate secretly
in small cells, it does not for the moment appear to present any
obvious threat to the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">communists<e_enamex>' nearly <b_timex type="DURATION">50-year<e_timex> rule.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>'s constitution allows for freedom of association and other
liberties. But working to change the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">communist<e_enamex>-run system is
illegal, and the party relentlessly punishes dissent.
	   Thus, party members in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex> work in small cells that operate
independently of each other to avoid detection, the party member
said.
	   He identified himself as <b_enamex type="PERSON">Chen Jin<e_enamex>, a pseudonym he said he has
used when signing petitions to the government calling for
democratic change.
	   He was generally circumspect about his own history. He said he
grew up in northeast <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>, studied in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>, where he works as a
business manager, and took part in democracy protests in <b_timex type="DATE">1989<e_timex> that
started on <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>'s <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square<e_enamex> and spread to other cities.
	   He said there were <b_numex type="CARDINAL">17<e_numex> members in his party cell, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> of <b_numex type="CARDINAL">three<e_numex> in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>. The other members range in age and include university
students, government bureaucrats, professors, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> laborers and a
lawyer, he said.
	   He estimated the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> other cells in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex> have a similar
number of members. Another cell operates in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Changchun<e_enamex> and another
is planned in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Harbin<e_enamex>, he said.
	   Both cities are in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>'s northeast, where dissatisfaction over
layoffs at run-down state firms is mounting.
	   According to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">New York<e_enamex>-based dissident <b_enamex type="PERSON">Fu Shenqi<e_enamex>, a spokesman for
the group, the party has at least <b_numex type="CARDINAL">100<e_numex> members in <b_numex type="CARDINAL">five<e_numex> to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">10<e_numex>
branches in provinces and cities across <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>.
	   The party's demands include freedom of speech, freedom of
assembly, freedom to protest, freedom of the press, and freedom to
set up opposition parties, the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Beijing<e_enamex>-based member said.
	   ``We all have a common conviction _ bringing political
diversification and political democracy to <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>,'' he said.
	   Asked how the party would recruit members, he described a
somewhat vague process whereby party members would start by
chatting to ordinary Chinese _ he mentioned taxi drivers, factory
workers, entrepreneurs and soldiers _ about issues of public
concern.
	   These could include official corruption within the party and
government, layoffs, or other sources of dissatisfaction that have
arisen in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">China<e_enamex>'s <b_timex type="DURATION">two-decade<e_timex> shift from a planned to a market
economy.
	   Through such contacts they would look for suitable people to
join the party, he said.
	   ``If after <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> meeting, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">two<e_numex> meetings, many meetings, we discover
that they think like us and are willing to operate in an
organization, then they will become a target for us,'' he said.
	   ``When we are strong, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party<e_enamex> will have lost its
ruling base, the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">army<e_enamex> won't carry out its orders,'' he added. ``At
that time, we'll use negotiations to resolve the problems in
society.''
