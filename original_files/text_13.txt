In troubled Yugoslav province, Serbs, too, are victims
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">PRISTINA<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Yugoslavia<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ He's a company director who wears
the best suits, collects fine art and counts the influential among
his friends. She's a worn-out refugee who sleeps under a borrowed
blanket.
	   Elsewhere, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boban Boskovic<e_enamex>, chief executive of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Plastika<e_enamex>
factory, would have nothing in common with <b_enamex type="PERSON">Ilinka Durbaba<e_enamex>, stuck in
a refugee camp for nearly <b_timex type="DURATION">three years<e_timex>. In <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>, they shoulder a
common burden.
	   They are Serbs in a part of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Serbia<e_enamex> controlled by a hostile
Albanian majority that outnumbers them <b_numex type="CARDINAL">9<e_numex> to <b_numex type="CARDINAL">1<e_numex>. And while the
Albanians groan under repressive Serbian rule, the average Serb in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex> feels threatened by the specter of a secessionist war.
	   The <b_enamex type="LOCATION">United States<e_enamex> and other world powers consider the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>
Albanians victims, and back their struggle for autonomy, if not for
independence.
	   The Albanians lost the right to virtual self-rule in <b_timex type="DATE">1989<e_timex>. Most
recently, Serb police killed at least <b_numex type="CARDINAL">80<e_numex> of them in a brutal
<b_timex type="DURATION">two-week<e_timex> crackdown on militant separatists.
	   As sympathy grows for the Albanians, hostility rises against
Serbs, who often are equated with their repressive government.
	   But in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>, Serbs, too, are victims.
	   Most work at low-paying government jobs or state companies that
often cannot meet payroll. Albanians, victims of mass firings in
the early <b_timex type="DATE">1990s<e_timex>, now dominate the private sector, their prosperity
reflected in large houses and modern stores.
	   <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex> Serbs are a despised minority on home ground. But they
cannot leave _ to keep them there, the government has forbidden
property sales.
	   <b_enamex type="PERSON">Milica Boskovic<e_enamex>, the director's wife, flinches when an Albanian
boy spits at her.
	   ``This isn't the worst of it,'' she says. Other Serb parents
nod. They walk their children to school, fearful of abuse from
Albanian kids. The school is split by a wall _ <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex> side for Serbs,
the other for Albanians.
	   ``Their kids swear at our kids,'' says Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boskovic<e_enamex>, mother of
<b_numex type="MEASURE">7<e_numex>- and <b_numex type="MEASURE">8-year<e_numex> old boys.
	   At the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">Plastika<e_enamex> factory, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boban Boskovic<e_enamex> says he does what he can
for harmony _ <b_numex type="CARDINAL">half<e_numex> his work force is ethnic Albanian.
	   Loyalties were forged after the plant burned down in <b_timex type="DATE">1983<e_timex>, <b_numex type="CARDINAL">one<e_numex>
of several fires thought set by Albanian separatists. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boskovic<e_enamex>
called a workers' meeting ahead of rebuilding.
	   ``I told them, `Here, I am your <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tito<e_enamex>, your <b_enamex type="PERSON">Milosevic<e_enamex>, your
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Rugova<e_enamex>,''' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boskovic<e_enamex>, referring respectively to the leader of
the former communist <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Yugoslavia<e_enamex>, who gave <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex> automony; his
successor who took it away, and the ethnic Albanian leader now
seeking independence. ``You've all got mouths to feed, whether they
are Serb or Albanian.''
	   Born and raised in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="PERSON">Boskovic<e_enamex> is proud of his roots in the
province, the cradle of Serb culture and Orthodox religion.
	   Pictures in his lavish office show him with archbishops, Serb
royalty _ and <b_enamex type="PERSON">Zeljko Raznatovic<e_enamex>, a.k.a <b_enamex type="PERSON">Arkan<e_enamex>, the Serb
ultranationalist whose troops are accused of atrocities in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Croatia<e_enamex>,
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Bosnia<e_enamex>, and, most recently, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>.
	   ``Where would I go?'' he replies, when asked if he is
contemplating leaving.
	   ``We must talk to them,'' he says of the Albanians. ``We should
have talked to them a long time ago.''
	   At the hairdresser's, Serb women discuss options. Stay or go?
	   They reflect on their good times in the <b_timex type="DATE">1950s<e_timex> and <b_timex type="DATE">1960s<e_timex>, and
what they view as <b_enamex type="PERSON">Tito<e_enamex>'s greatest mistake _ giving <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex> autonomy
in <b_timex type="DATE">1974<e_timex>. That, a high Albanian birthrate and an influx from
neighboring <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Albania<e_enamex> left the Serbs cornered by the <b_timex type="DATE">1980s<e_timex>.
	   ``We had everything,'' says <b_enamex type="PERSON">Zhivka Savic<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">65<e_numex>. ``They had
nothing.''
	   The reverse seems true now. The <b_numex type="MEASURE">two-chair<e_numex> salon is squeezed
among modern, well-equipped Albanian shops.
	   ``Compare my little house to a <b_numex type="MEASURE">six-story<e_numex> Albanian one,'' Mrs.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Savic<e_enamex> rails, ignoring warnings from other women to hush because of
the thin wall and the Albanian shop next door. ``Sell to an
Albanian? In a <b_timex type="DURATION">minute<e_timex>, if they let us.''
	   ``In my street, ... Albanian kids have started chanting `we are
the terrorists.''
	   Hairdresser <b_enamex type="PERSON">Milanka Milentijevic<e_enamex> says <b_numex type="PERCENT">80 percent<e_numex> of her
customers were Albanians in the <b_timex type="DATE">1970s<e_timex>.
	   ``Now, I have <b_numex type="MEASURE">one a month<e_numex>. Business is down <b_numex type="PERCENT">95 percent<e_numex>,'' she
says. ``Even the Serbs who could afford to come left a long time
ago.''
	   About <b_numex type="CARDINAL">200<e_numex> of her relatives have left the area, but Mrs.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Milentijevic<e_enamex> wants to stay _ for now. She describes Albanian
acquaintances as ``friends in hiding.''
	   ``We talk about everything. Families, politics,'' says Mrs.
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Milentijevic<e_enamex>, <b_numex type="MEASURE">50<e_numex>. ``Sometimes we even joke about the situation.''
	   Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Durbaba<e_enamex>, the refugee, contemplates her options. Sitting on
a cot in a space blanketed off from the next family, she says she
started running at <b_numex type="MEASURE">3<e_numex>, from the Germans during World War II. In
<b_timex type="DATE">1995<e_timex>, she fled her town of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Knin<e_enamex> in <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Croatia<e_enamex>, when Croats recaptured
it from rebel Serbs, who had seized it in <b_timex type="DATE">1991<e_timex>.
	   Is it time to run again?
	   ``I have nowhere to go,'' she says, sobbing.
	   She turns to a poster of <b_enamex type="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic<e_enamex>, the Yugoslav
president. He stoked the war that forced her to flee <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Knin<e_enamex> and his
decision to abolish <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kosovo<e_enamex>'s autonomy radicalized the Albanians.
	   ``I love him,'' says Mrs. <b_enamex type="PERSON">Durbaba<e_enamex>. ``He's good for everybody who
loves peace.''
