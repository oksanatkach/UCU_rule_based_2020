Kenyans protest tax hikes
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">NAIROBI<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex> (<b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">AP<e_enamex>) _ <b_numex type="CARDINAL">Thousands<e_numex> of laborers, students and
opposition politicians on <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex> protested tax hikes imposed by
their cash-strapped government, which they accused of failing to
provide basic services.
	   Beneath a scorching sun, they sang anti-government songs and
chanted ``<b_enamex type="PERSON">Moi<e_enamex> must go,'' showing their derision for President
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Daniel arap Moi<e_enamex>, <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>'s ruler for <b_timex type="DURATION">20 years<e_timex>.
	   By voice vote, the <b_numex type="CARDINAL">5,000<e_numex> protesters approved a resolution
calling for the government to scrap new taxes, convene a convention
to write a new Constitution, stop harassing students and street
vendors, and halt ethnic violence.
	   If the government doesn't respond to the demands, workers should
go on strike <b_timex type="DATE">April 3<e_timex>, said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kivutha Kibwana<e_enamex>, of the <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">National
Convention Assembly<e_enamex>, a group of opposition political, church and
civic leaders who organized the rally.
	   Although the crowd cheered its support, the assembly's calls for
general strikes have failed in the past.
	   Kenyans are most angered by tax increases announced earlier this
month to plug a widening budget deficit.
	   The price of gas and diesel went up, and tax deductions were
revoked on gifts to charities and nonprofit organizations. Faced
with a strike by bank workers, <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION" status="opt">Finance<e_enamex> Minister <b_enamex type="PERSON">Simeon Nyachae<e_enamex>
delayed plans to raise taxes on cut-rate loans provided by
employers.
	   Several politicians have charged that the high taxes Kenyans
already pay go into the pockets of government officials or wasteful
projects, and not into providing essential services and repairing
crumbling infrastructure.
	   ``I would like <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moi<e_enamex> to explain and bring back the money he has
stolen,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">Kenneth Matiba<e_enamex>, who ran second to <b_enamex type="PERSON">Moi<e_enamex> in the <b_timex type="DATE">1992<e_timex>
election.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund<e_enamex> has demanded spending cuts and
tax hikes, warning that in the absence of corrective measures,
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>'s overall budget deficit for <b_timex type="DATE">1997<e_timex>-<b_timex type="DATE">98<e_timex> will reach <b_numex type="PERCENT">3.9 percent<e_numex>
of the gross domestic product _ more than double the goal of <b_numex type="PERCENT">1.7
percent<e_numex>.
	   The <b_enamex type="ORGANIZATION">IMF<e_enamex> last year withheld a <b_numex type="MONEY">dlrs 220 million<e_numex> loan from <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>,
citing official corruption and mismanagement.
	   In contrast to other rallies which have drawn mostly male
students, <b_timex type="DATE">Saturday<e_timex>'s rally also attracted laborers, businessmen and
women.
	   They demonstrated at the <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kamukunji Grounds<e_enamex>, a grassy field in
<b_enamex type="LOCATION">Nairobi<e_enamex> where Kenyans have often gathered to show their
dissatisfaction with the government.
	   ``We, the people of <b_enamex type="LOCATION">Kenya<e_enamex>, have met here several times. We have
been beaten, we have shed blood, we have purchased the right to
meet here today with our blood,'' said <b_enamex type="PERSON">John Munuve<e_enamex>, an assembly
leader.
	   The protest was peaceful, and no police were deployed.
	   In <b_timex type="DATE">July<e_timex>, police killed more than a <b_numex type="CARDINAL">dozen<e_numex> demonstrators pressing
for constitutional reforms before elections in <b_timex type="DATE">December<e_timex>, in which
<b_enamex type="PERSON">Moi<e_enamex> won a fifth, <b_timex type="DURATION">five-year<e_timex> term.
